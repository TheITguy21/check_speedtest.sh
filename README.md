# Prerequisites
The following packages must be present on your system for the script to work:
- bc
- speedtest cli by Ookla https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli

  ‚ö† Before installing "speedtest", you should first read Ookla's "EULA", "Terms of Use" and "Privacy Policy", and make sure you're ok with it
  - Ookla EULA: https://www.speedtest.net/about/eula
  - Ookla Terms of Use: https://www.speedtest.net/about/terms
  - Ookla Privacy Policy: https://www.speedtest.net/about/privacy
  
  Also, you should be aware the installation of speedtest by Ookla through their script "script.deb.sh" does the following (amongst others):
  - runs the "apt-get update" command
  - installs the gnupg package
  - installs the debian-archive-keyring package
  - installs the apt-trasport-https
  - creates a debian repository configuration file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ookla_speedtest-cli
  - creates a GPG keyring and imports keys from https://packagecloud.io/ookla/speedtest-cli/gpgkey
